🧹 3. Data Cleaning Steps

✔ Checked missing values → None found
✔ Removed duplicates → 20,171 rows removed
✔ Converted necessary columns to numeric
✔ Standardized locality names
✔ Final Shape → 51,767 rows × 15 columns

This ensures clean and consistent data for analysis.

📊 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (Visual Insights)
🔹1 Price Distribution

Shows how property prices are spread across the city
(Results: Highly skewed due to luxury zones)

🔹2 Area Distribution

Reveals typical house sizes and outliers

🔹3 Price vs Area (Scatter Plot)

Clear trend:
✔ Bigger area → Higher price
✔ Some properties extremely overpriced (luxury outliers)

🔹4 Correlation Heatmap

Highlights key relationships:

Area ↗ Price (strong correlation)

Bedrooms ↗ Price

Locality plays a major role

🔹5 Top 10 Most Expensive Localities

Based on average property price:
